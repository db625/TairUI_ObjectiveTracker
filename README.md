# TairUI Objective Tracker

A minimalist World of Warcraft objective tracker focused on immersion and casual gameplay.

## Features

- Always tracks your **focused quest**.
  - To focus a quest, open the quest log and click the circle icon next to its name, or right-click a quest and choose **Focus**.
- Automatically shows **nearby active quests** with objectives in your current area.
- **Ignores world quests** for a cleaner experience.
  - To track a world quest, set it as your focused quest.
- **Ignores "watched" quests** (those with a check mark in the quest log).
  - This helps avoid clutter and keeps the tracker clean and intentional.
- Supports **dungeon and scenario objectives**, including **Delves** and **The Nightfall** event.
  - *Note: Not extensively tested with content prior to patch 11.0.*
- Fully compatible with **Edit Mode**.
  - Tracker positioning syncs automatically with Blizzard’s default tracker.
